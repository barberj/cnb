    <span class="tehword">Life</span> is full of interpersonal and emotional challenges.
    Sometimes these periods of uncertainty and challenge can be frightening. However,
    I believe they provide an opportunity to grow, attain inner peace and
    create a new beginning. My goal is to provide a safe and confidential
    space in which you can explore your personal concerns in order to develop
    and attain personal goals, achieve authentic relationships and gain self awareness.

    <h2>Children</h2>
    I enjoy working with parents to create a healthy environment in which their
    children can thrive. I typically meet with the parents first to hear all about
    their childâ€™s strengths and struggles. Then, as I meet with your child I measure
    their self-concept, anxiety, depression, anger, resiliency, and reactivity as I
    hear from them what is working in their life and what is not.

    <h2>Adolescents</h2>
    <div style="float:right;margin-left:2em;" class="well">
      Counseling services to help children and their families with:
      <ul>
        <li>Behavioral problems</li>
        <li>Academic struggles</li>
        <li>Social skill deficits</li>
        <li>Friendship issues</li>
        <li>Family conflict</li>
        <li>Worries / Anxiety / Stress</li>
        <li>Low self-esteem</li>
        <li>Separation and Divorce Issues</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    I enjoy the challenge of adolescent counseling &amp; helping teens navigate
    the tricky waters of middle school and high school. Being an adolescent
    is not easy; managing schoolwork, peer pressure, sports, relationships,
    electronics, driving, and college applications can be overwhelming. Conflict
    around these issues can put teens and their parents at risk for depression and anxiety.
    <br /><br />
    I work to help teens appreciate their parents and help parents celebrate the launching
    of their teens. I teach adolescents social and life skills that will serve them
    throughout their life in schools, families, and in the job market.

    <h2>Therapy for Individuals</h2>
    <div class="well" style="float:left;margin-right:2em;width:50%;">
      Common concerns brought by individual clients include symptoms of:
      <ul>
        <li>Relationship Struggles</li>
        <li>Work Stress including Underemployment / Unemployment</li>
        <li>Anxiety</li>
        <li>Grief</li>
        <li>Low Self-Esteem</li>
      </ul>
      Issues such as these are handled in a compassionate, non-blaming approach.
      Therapy is focused on solutions and attempts to bring about short-term
      relief as well as long-term change.
    </div>
    The adults that I work with are successful, smart, and determined to work
    on the one or two areas that are not working in their lives. I partner with
    them in building more satisfying personal lives, relationships, and careers.
    I see people who have tried everything and have made the courageous decision
    to admit they need some help.
    <br /><br />
    Nothing is more frustrating than trying really hard and still feeling
    like the particular problem is not getting better. I help my clients learn
    new approaches, so they don't simply try hard, but actually see progress.
    Most clients report they wish they had started the process sooner!
